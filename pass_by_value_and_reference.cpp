/*References are used to refer an existing variable in another name whereas pointers are used to store address of variable.

References cannot have a null value assigned but pointer can.

A reference variable can be referenced by pass by value whereas a pointer can be referenced by pass by reference.

A reference must be initialized on declaration while it is not necessary in case of pointer.

A reference shares the same memory address with the original variable but also takes up some space on the stack whereas a pointer has its own memory address and size on the stack
